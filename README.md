# Automated-Testing-for-Self-Driving-Cars

The world of deep learning has seen great strides in advancement over the past few decades in areas such as object tracking and recognition, natural language processing, robotics, and self-driving cars. With such advancements and the increasing use of deep learning in safety-critical applications, such as self-driving cars, the importance of ensuring these deep learning models possess a high degree of dependability and security has never been greater

This proposal comprises a uniform distribution sampling strategy for selecting seeds (images), which will be subjected to a CGF metamorphic mutation algorithm. The structural similarity index measure (SSIM) is used to retain the core semantic authenticity within mutated seed data
